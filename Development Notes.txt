dGP is defined to be the amount of games played in the target year above the average number of games played in the previous four seasons. Null values are omitted and not treated as 0. Making dGP the target variable instead of GP improved model accuracy.

Be careful when considering features other than age, height, and weight. Make sure to index 'statline' correctly so that the subset of the list represents the target/dependent variable. This applies in the for index, statline in enumerate() loop in neural_network_projections.py.

XGBoost features:
1. RF Projection
2. RR Projection
3. BNN Projection
4. NN Projection
5. SVR Projection
6. Y-1 Stat
7. Y-2 Stat (Null if needed)
8. Y-3 Stat (Null if needed)
Perform cross-validation with eta and gamma, etc if wanted. See how features 6-8 impact predictions.

!! Add a neural network architecture/hyperparameter catalog CSV file / Turn the storage of model architectures/hyperparameters into a CSV (currently commented in model_analysis.py)
--> Also another document briefing the differences between each NN projector for the different stats (filters, features, etc.)
