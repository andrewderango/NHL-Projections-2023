    <h1>NHL Player Projections</h1>

    <p>Welcome to my NHL Projections page! Here, you can find statistic projections for 950 NHL players for the 2023-24 season, as of the start of the season. These projections are the result of a complex stacked ensemble machine learning pipieline employing a variety of models including Bayesian neural networks, extreme gradient boosting, and bootstrapped random forest regression..</p>
